                <p class="story-p">Sung Jinwoo's daily life wasn't very different
                    from anyone else's. He had a happy family,                
                    close friends, and a peaceful day-to-day routine.<br><br>               
                    He thought that his ordinary life would never change.                
                    But a sudden cataclysm rocked                
                    the world and upended his life completely.<br><br>                                                
                    Sung Jinwoo's firefighting father was forced to start                
                    dealing with magic beasts. Instead of crime,               
                    news broadcasts were filled with reports of monster incidents.<br><br>                                            
                    People who had the special power to fight
                    against them became bigger than celebrities.<br><br>
                    The day he saw his father on TV, Sung Jinwoo
                    finally realized that his life was never going back.<br><br>
                    His father was no longer the protector of his family:
                    he was a protector of the world.
                    And the world was constantly throwing him onto the front lines.<br><br>
                    Sung Jinwoo worried that every morning "goodbye" might be their last.<br><br>
                    His mother hardly acknowledged the change -
                    after all, firefighting hadn't exactly been a safe career, either.
                    But the household atmosphere was different from before.<br><br>
                    His father must've realized how anxious his family was feeling.
                    He often tried to alleviate their collective anxiety with jokes and goofy faces.<br><br>
                    Sung Jinwoo understood what his father was trying to do,
                    and tried to play along. But fear cannot be so easily erased.<br><br>
                    One day, his father suggested going on a family picnic.
                    He said he felt bad about not being able to take them
                    to a popular amusement park because he was always busy with work.<br><br>
                    Unfortunately, Sung Jinwoo was the only one
                    who was available that day.
                    Sung Jinwoo suggested that they all go together on a different day,
                    but his father was desperate to do something to lighten the mood.<br><br>
                    So, for the first time in his life, Sung Jinwoo went on a picnic
                    with his father at the amusement park. It was awkward, but kind of fun.<br><br>
                    That one day of peaceful, daily life was the first time
                    in a while Jinwoo had felt normal.
                    For a moment, his anxiety melted like spring snow.<br><br>
                    But that fear that had followed Jinwoo every morning,
                    finally forgotten, suddenly came true.
                    That day ended up being the last day he'd spend with his father.<br><br>
                    A gate opened in the center of the amusement park,
                    and his father disappeared inside.
                    After an agonizingly long time, Jinwoo's father returned with an
                    injured person he had rescued from its depths, then returned for more.<br><br>
                    His father rescued person after person, until finally, the gate closed.<br><br>
                    The adults tried to comfort Jinwoo.
                    "We'll find your father no matter what. Don't worry."
                    "Your father is a big, strong hero, so I'm sure he's fine."
                    But Jinwoo kept searching the area.<br><br>
                    None of their words reached him.<br><br>
                    Sung Jinwoo returned home alone and
                    tearfully told his mother what had happened.<br><br>
                    His mother buried her face in her hands for a moment,
                    then took a deep breath, and steadied
                    her voice as she spoke to her children.<br><br>
                    "I'm sure he's alive somewhere. He's a strong man."<br><br>
                    Sung Jinwoo and his younger sister, Sung Jinah,
                    nodded at their mother's words.<br><br>
                    For five long years, Sung Jinwoo believed her, and waited for his father to return.
                    But before that day could arrive, Jinwoo's mother collapsed.<br><br>
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="story-infos" id="story-2">
                <p class="story-p">Five years had passed since Sung Jinwoo's father disappeared.
                    While his father was gone, the world was constantly changing.<br><br>
                    People started calling the awakened people "hunters"
                    and devised ranking systems. As Essence Stones gained attention
                    as an energy source, hunters and guilds began to get very wealthy.
                    As a result, major guilds formed and began to fight over high-ranking gates.<br><br>
                    When an S-Rank gate opened on Jeju Island,
                    they teamed up to take it on, but failed. It remained open.
                    The incident resulted in numerous casualties,
                    and the island was left uninhabitable.<br><br>
                    Jargon such as "hunter", "gate", "dungeon", "magic beasts", "essence stones",
                    and "mana" became part of people's daily lives,
                    but this change was not without side effects.
                    Those who couldn't adapt to mana began to fall into a deep, endless sleep.<br><br>
                    Sung Jinwoo's mother was among those
                    who couldn't adapt; she succumbed to Eternal Slumber.<br><br>
                    Eternal Slumber has no cure. Prolonging victims' lives required expensive equipment
                    that ran on Essence Stones, and only those who could afford the increasing privacy_policy_en?locale
                    of Essence Stones were able to pay the expensive hospital bills.<br><br>
                    Poorer families had no choice but to stand by
                    and watch their relatives waste away. Many victims of Eternal Slumber died.<br><br>
                    Sung Jinwoo, who had just turned 20 years old,
                    didn't have a way to pay for his mother's treatment.
                    The money that his mother had saved for his college tuition
                    could only pay three months' worth of hospital bills.<br><br>
                    As a result, Sung Jinwoo began working whatever jobs he could get.
                    He did everything he could to make money,
                    all while sleeping and eating less and less.<br><br>
                    However, there was a limit to how much he could earn
                    through ordinary jobs. What he needed was a job like the hunters had.<br><br>
                    If his father were around, would he have felt less burdened?
                    He thought of his still-missing father as he drifted off to sleep after a long day's work.<br><br>
                    Sung Jinwoo couldn't just sit around and wait for his father to come back.
                    Since his mother was unconscious, he was the head of the family.<br><br>
                    Once the hospital bills exhausted his mother's savings,
                    Sung Jinwoo knew he had to do something.<br><br></p>
            </div>
            <div class="story-infos" id="story-3">
                <p class="story-p">Anyone who's awakened will tell you,
                    "I just got my powers one day."                
                    Though nothing particularly special had happened,                
                    when they woke up, they could feel their new strength                
                    - or, at least, that their bodies were different from usual.<br><br>
                    Sung Jinwoo thought those stories were all exaggerated.                
                    But when he woke up in a hospital room uninjured, he realized they were true.<br><br>
                    He had been exhausted; the load on his back was heavy,                
                    and the stairs leading higher into the building were steep.                
                    Perhaps it was because he wasn't eating properly,                
                    or maybe it was the heat, but he suddenly felt very dizzy.                
                    When he closed his eyes for a moment, he lost his balance.<br><br>
                    Just like that, Sung Jinwoo fell down the stairs,                
                    and the heavy load fell on top of him.                
                    As he slipped from consciousness,                
                    he heard the frantic voices of the workers                
                    who surrounded him - and then, their voices were gone.<br><br>
                    Sung Jinwoo dreamed, and in his dream, he saw his father.                
                    His father was staring at him from inside the gate at the amusement park.<br><br>              
                    Jinwoo wasn't sure if he should be happy or resentful.                
                    The situation was strange and incomprehensible.                
                    Sung Jinwoo thought for a while before finally speaking.<br><br>             
                    "It's been a while."<br><br>
                    There were so many things he wanted to say
                    when his father returned, but seeing him face to face like this,
                    all he could do was greet him.<br><br>
                    His father continued to stare at Sung Jinwoo and then
                    squeezed his hand tightly as he shouted something.<br><br>
                    Strangely, he couldn't hear his father's voice,
                    but he could feel his father's strength when he held his hand.<br><br>
                    Sung Jinwoo read his father's lips as he shouted with all his might,
                    and as soon as he understood the word,
                    "heart," light poured from behind his father's back                
                    and Sung Jinwoo opened his eyes...<br><br>
                    He realized then that seeing his father had been a dream.                
                    He'd been taken to the hospital after falling down the stairs.<br><br>  
                    He also realized that he felt physically stronger and more capable
                    - like some small amount of power had entered his body,                
                    just like how other people who had awakened had described it.<br><br>
                    Immediately after he was discharged from the hospital,                
                    Sung Jinwoo went straight to the Hunters Association.                
                    As expected, he was an awakened being...<br><br>
                    But his mana level was only 10,                
                    far less than the minimum of 70.               
                    Thus, "The Weakest Hunter of All Mankind" was born.<br><br></p>
